## Background

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a `customer segmentation technique` used in marketing to evaluate and understand customer behavior.

The `dataset` include data on sales of consumer goods obtained by ‘scanning’ the bar codes for individual products at electronic points of sale in a retail store. 

The data provide `detailed information` about quantities, characteristics and values of goods sold as well as their prices.

The anonymized dataset includes `64.682 transactions` of 5.242 SKU's sold to 22.625 customers during one year.


## Stakeholders

- Marketing Team: Responsible for designing and `implementing marketing strategies` based on RFM analysis results.


## Problem Statement

- How can the supermarket use RFM analysis to `segment customers` based on purchasing behavior and optimize promotions to improve customer retention and engagement?
  

## Goals

- By implementing RFM analysis, companies can `classify customers based on their value`, develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment to increase customer retention and maximize profits.
  

## Insight 

Customer Segmentation uses a combination of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores to group customers into 10 categories.

`Champion:` Customers who have recently made a purchase, transact very often, and have a large monetary contribution. They are the most valuable customers.

 `Loyal Customer:` Customers who shop frequently and have a stable contribution, although their transactions are not always new.

`Potential Loyalists:` Customers who have just started shopping frequently and have the potential to become loyal if well-retained.

`New Customers:` New customers who have just made their first purchase.

`Promising:` Customers who have just started transacting but are not regular, can become loyal if given encouragement.

`Need Attention:` Customers who may have been active but are starting to lose their frequency and need attention to get them back.

`About to Sleep:` Customers who are barely active and are on the verge of ceasing to transact.

`At Risk:` Customers who were once active but are now rarely transacting, they are at risk of leaving the brand.

`Hibernating:` Customers who are rarely transacting and have little to no activity.

`Lost:` Customers who have not transacted in a long time, indicating that they may have left the brand.


## Conclusion & Recommendation

### Conclusion

This segmentation provides a very clear view of customer behavior based on their engagement with the brand. From the most loyal customers to those who have left the brand, this code allows companies to understand the condition and status of each customer. With this information, companies can tailor their marketing and retention approaches based on each segment, from retaining their best customers to reviving customers who are close to being lost.

### Recommendation

`Champion:` These are the best customers to retain. 

- Recommendation: Provide exclusive services, premium rewards, loyalty programs, or special invitations to brand events.

`Loyal Customer:` They are stable customers. 

- Recommendation: Provide them with additional benefits such as regular discounts, early access to new products, or long-term loyalty programs.

`Potential Loyalists:` Customers who have the potential to become loyal customers. 

- Recommendation: Provide attractive offers, discounts on their next purchase, or membership programs to strengthen their loyalty.

`New Customers:` New customers need a good first experience. 

- Recommendation: Offer a warm welcome, special discount on their next purchase, or a referral program to bring them back.

`Promising:` These customers are promising, but not yet fully engaged. 

- Recommendation: Offer more personalized promotions, special offers, or encouragement for repeat purchases.

`Need Attention:` These customers need more attention to re-engage. 

- Recommendation: Send email reminders, special offers, or limited-time discounts to entice them to shop again.

`About to Sleep:` These customers are on the verge of falling out of favor. 

- Recommendation: Create a retention campaign with a “last minute” offer or aggressive promotion before they fall out of favor.

`At Risk:` Customers who are at risk of leaving the brand. 

- Recommendation: Re-engage with a compelling offer, such as a big discount or a loyalty program specifically for returning customers.

`Hibernating:` Customers who are very infrequent spenders. 

- Recommendation: Create a special "We Miss You" campaign, or offer a discounted product bundle to lure them back.

`Lost:` Customers who have been lost for a long time and are unlikely to return. 

- Recommendation: Reactivation campaigns with irresistible offers or special programs for returning customers after a long period of inactivity or simply let them go.

With the right strategy for each segment, companies can be more effective in managing customers, increasing retention, and optimizing marketing spend to increase the lifetime value of each customer segment.
